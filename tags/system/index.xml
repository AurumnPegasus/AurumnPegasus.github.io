      <description>So I used to love ElementaryOS (still do :p) even as a programmer, since its UI was intuitive and clean, and nothing else needed to be done on top of it.

Simple enough, I tried to update it as I had tried to update by Ubuntu (you could do that simply by a command on terminal).</description>
