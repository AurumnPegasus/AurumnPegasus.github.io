      <description>This blog is about my contributions to sktime during GSoC &amp;lsquo;22.
Introduction sktime is a library based on sklearn meant for time-series data and problems. It has easy to use implementations of important statistical and ML-based estimators for the purposes of classification, regression and forecasting. This summer, I joined the sktime time on the project to add DL estimators to sktime.
The main motivation for adding DL models in sktime is the recent surge in using DL networks in time series related computational problems.</description>
